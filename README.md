## General Information
A simple clock app with not much more there. It is not the best way to make a clock, but it's definetly one of them.\
Some specific nuances are an animation on when the page loads in and an image of a dog that changes to a different one if page is viewed in portrait or landscape mode.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+

## Launching and Viewing
- Web app uses JavaScript modules imports, which does not work on locally opened files in the browser. I suggest viewing it through the live demo link.
- To have it all working locally I used VSCode and an extension called Live Server. 
- After cloning the repository and opening VSCode simply install Live Server through Extensions tab, right click on the index.html and then click Open with Live Server. It will take care of everything.
- There are also other ways that will work, like even XAMPP live server, but I have not used those.

## Project Status
Project is done for now, but not finished. The implementation of the clock arms is rather quirky and not smooth at all due to how I created it. I might try once again after some time and make it smoother and overall better.
